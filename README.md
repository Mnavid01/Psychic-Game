Psychic Game Homework For Bootcamp
The Goal:
I made an attempt at the Psychc Game, for the assignment I am to build a game utilizing JavaScript, in which the computer will generate a random letter, the user will have 10 chances to guess that letter in my version of the game.
Whenever the user chooses the correct letter with-in the 10 tries, their win counter will increase by 1, and if the user is to lose, their losses counter will increase by 1.
Everytime the user is to win or lose the game, the counter will reset without the page re-loading.

What was used:
The game was created using JavaScript

The website will randomly choose a letter, the goal is for the user to guess the letter by pressing on the keyboard.
